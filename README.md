# TFG_DilithiumFinalVersion

This is a repository starting with the basic Dilithium version of [TFG](https://github.com/AriadnaPrat/TFG)
The basic Dilithium scheme is interactive, and the goal of this repository is to get a non-interactive Dilithium scheme with Fiat-Shamir transform. Our code will be based on Lyuvashesvky's paper.

### Features
- CRYSTALS-Dilithium digital signature implementation
- Post-quantum cryptography
